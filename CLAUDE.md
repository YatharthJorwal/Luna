# Luna — Local AI Desktop Companion

A fully local, offline-capable desktop pet: a Live2D body, a real LLM brain,
a tsundere personality, persistent long-term memory, and on-demand
screen/camera vision. She's less a chatbot and more **a guide who lives on
the PC** — tell her what you're trying to do, she gives you the next
concrete step, and keeps half an eye on the screen while that task is
active to nudge you back if you wander off (Task Guide Mode — the flagship
behavior, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). She never touches the mouse/keyboard
or executes anything herself: observe-and-advise only.

**Non-negotiable constraint: 100% local.** No cloud LLM calls, no cloud TTS,
no telemetry. Everything — inference, voice, memory — runs on the user's own
machine. This overrides convenience every time.

## Current status

Phase 1 done and running on the user's machine (Windows, RTX 3060 12GB) —
shell, tray, Live2D rendering, and the audio pipeline all work end-to-end.
**Phase 2 (real local LLM, single-pass persona, streamed text → TTS →
lip-sync, session memory)** is built and verified end-to-end in the
sandbox, not yet confirmed on the user's machine — real voice is still
pyttsx3 (unchanged from Phase 1), model still Hiyori (placeholder).
Full phase-by-phase status: `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Docs map

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design: the three tiers, why Tauri, why a
  Python orchestrator, personality architecture, memory design, vision
  tools, full Task Guide Mode spec, directory layout.
- `docs/MODELS.md` — which LLM/VLM/TTS to actually run, locked to the user's
  hardware, plus a fallback table if hardware changes.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — in/out of scope, phase-by-phase plan and status, open
  decisions still needing input.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — why non-obvious things in the code are the way they
  are, especially fixes forced by reality during implementation (e.g. why
  `vendor/pixi-live2d5/` exists instead of a normal npm dependency). Read
  this before assuming something looks like a mistake.
- `README.md` — human setup/run instructions, not agent context.

## Working agreement

- Model/engine choices are config, never hardcoded — the LLM endpoint, model
  name, and TTS engine should all live in one config file so they can change
  without touching app logic.
- Don't add cloud calls of any kind without being asked explicitly.
- Keep the persona pass separable from the core reasoning pass in code, even
  while it's collapsed into one prompt for now (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) —
  don't hard-couple them.
- Vision/audio work must never block the Tauri UI thread; long-running work
  belongs in the orchestrator, not the shell.
- Camera access always goes through the explicit permission + indicator path
  in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — don't add a silent/continuous capture mode.
- Prefer editing/extending an existing tool over adding a new overlapping one.
- When a fix or design choice isn't obvious from the diff alone, add it to
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` in the same change, not as an afterthought.
