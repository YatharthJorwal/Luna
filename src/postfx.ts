/**
 * The post chain.
 *
 * An honest note on "ray tracing", because it was asked for by name: real
 * ray/path tracing at interactive rates isn't available here. This is WebGL2
 * through three.js, and the machine also has to run a VRM with spring bones,
 * an LLM bridge and a TTS pipeline at the same time. What *is* available is
 * the set of screen-space approximations that the offline-render look mostly
 * comes from, and those are what this file assembles:
 *
 *   - GTAO (ground-truth ambient occlusion) -- contact darkening in corners,
 *     under furniture, where a wall meets a floor. This is the single effect
 *     that most reads as "raytraced" to people, because unoccluded ambient
 *     light is the most obviously CG thing about a naive render.
 *   - Bloom on the emissive lamps and screens, driven by the time of day, so
 *     night reads as lamps glowing rather than lamps being pale shapes.
 *   - ACES Filmic tone mapping with per-mode exposure (set on the renderer,
 *     not here) so highlights roll off instead of clipping to white.
 *   - SMAA, because the composer bypasses the renderer's MSAA.
 *
 * Everything is behind a quality switch. GTAO in particular is the expensive
 * pass, and on a 3060 sharing the card with the rest of the stack it's worth
 * being able to drop it without losing bloom and tone mapping.
