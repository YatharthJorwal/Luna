// VRM lipsync -- architecturally different from the Live2D version this
// replaces, and deliberately so, not just a mechanical port. The Live2D
// version had to hook into Cubism5InternalModel's "beforeModelUpdate"
// event because Cubism restores parameters from a snapshot at the start
// of every frame, wiping anything set from an independent rAF loop before
// it could ever visibly land (see docs/DECISIONS.md's STT/lipsync entries
// for that whole saga). VRM's VRMExpressionManager has no such
// snapshot/restore cycle -- confirmed by actually reading
// @pixiv/three-vrm-core's bundled source (not assumed just because it
// seemed architecturally different): `setValue()` just sets
// `expression.weight` directly, and `update()` reads whatever that
// current weight is and applies it -- so a plain independent
// requestAnimationFrame loop calling setValue() each frame, right before
// vrm.update(delta), works correctly here. That loop lives in main.ts
// (there's one shared scene-wide rAF loop, not one per audio clip), which
// is why this file doesn't drive anything itself -- it only tracks
// *which* mouth-openness value that shared loop should read this frame.

// ---- Mouth-openness math (pure, so it can be checked without a renderer) --
//
// A real session showed her mouth snapped wide open -- fangs and tongue
// showing -- on single frames. The model's teeth are fine: that is simply
// what VRoid's "aa" shape looks like at full weight, and the old driver
// pushed it there constantly, for three reasons:
//   1. It read only 128 samples (an AnalyserNode's frequencyBinCount, half
//      of fftSize 256) = a few milliseconds, shorter than one voiced pitch
//      cycle's worth of structure, so each frame saw whatever part of the
//      waveform it happened to land on and the value flapped 0..1 per frame.
//   2. rms * 4 clipped at 1.0 for ordinary speech (the TTS output is loud).
//   3. Nothing smoothed or capped it, and no noise gate kept room tone from
//      nudging the mouth.
// Fix: read a ~20-40 ms window, gate the floor, map through a soft curve,
// cap the opening at MOUTH_MAX_OPEN (full "aa" is never reached), and ease
// toward the target with a fast attack and a slower release.
//
// These are first-guess numbers: there is no renderer in the dev sandbox, so
// nobody has seen the result on the real model. Tune MOUTH_MAX_OPEN first.
