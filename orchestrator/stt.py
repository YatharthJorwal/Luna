"""
Speech-to-text via faster-whisper. `transcribe(audio_bytes) -> str` is the
only thing app.py calls -- mirrors tts.py's `synthesize()` shape: one
function, config-driven, doesn't leak the underlying library upward.

API shape (model_size/device/compute_type, `.transcribe()` returning
segments to join) confirmed against a real reference implementation, not
assumed -- see docs/DECISIONS.md and docs/MODELS.md's STT section.

Model loading is lazy (first call to transcribe(), not import time like
config.py's CONFIG) -- WhisperModel() pulls weights from Hugging Face on
first-ever run and takes a real moment to load onto CPU/GPU after that, and
unlike the LLM/TTS configs there's no reason to pay that cost at orchestrator
startup for a feature the user might not use in a given session.

# this blocks the same connection's receive loop, subsequently typed chat
# too) hanging indefinitely with nothing in the log. This turns "hangs
