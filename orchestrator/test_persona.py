"""
Tests for persona.py's apply_persona_pass() -- both safety nets are pure
regex logic with no network/LLM/event-loop involved, so (unlike most of
this project) these are genuinely, fully testable rather than "logically
checked, not confirmed." No test file existed for the original dash
safety net before this one; added here as real regression coverage
alongside the new you're/You're one, rather than leaving both to ad hoc
sandbox checks only.

# Canary: the "you can only observe and advise" framing that predated
# Phase 4's tools was found, live on the user's own machine, to actively
# suppress capture_screen/read_clipboard tool use -- an isolated raw
# Ollama call with the real tool schemas and no system prompt called
# capture_screen correctly; the same call through Luna's real system
# prompt never called any tool across several real attempts. Fixed by
# telling her plainly she has these two real tools and should use them,
# while keeping the "no mouse/keyboard/code/files" boundary for
# everything else. This test exists so a future prompt edit can't
# silently reintroduce the same blanket "you can only observe and
# advise" line without a test failing -- see docs/DECISIONS.md for the
# full diagnosis.
