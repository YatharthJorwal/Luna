"""
Async streaming client for the configured local LLM server. Supports two
wire protocols, picked by config.yaml's llm.api_style:

- "openai": the generic OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions shape --
  SSE `data: {...}` lines, `[DONE]` sentinel. Works against Ollama or a
  llama.cpp server, since both speak it.
- "ollama_native": Ollama's own /api/chat -- NDJSON (one JSON object per
  line, no `data:` prefix), a `"done": true` flag on the final line
  instead of a sentinel. Ollama-only.

Why bother with two: Ollama's /v1 endpoint unreliably forwards the
"disable thinking" flag for hybrid-thinking models (confirmed via several
open Ollama issues as of mid-2026 -- see docs/DECISIONS.md), where the
native /api/chat is confirmed to honor it. config.yaml's llm.think is only
sent -- and only reliably honored -- in "ollama_native" mode.

Phase 4 added two more entry points, both ollama_native-only (see their
own docstrings for why): stream_reply_with_tools() for the main
conversation's tool-calling loop, and describe_image() for vision.py's
internal screenshot-to-text call. Neither touches stream_reply() above,
which consolidation.py/forget.py's background LLM calls still use
unchanged.

Context window: every native-Ollama request goes through _ollama_options(),
which stamps the same options.num_ctx (config.yaml's llm.num_ctx) on all of
them -- chat, tool-calling, vision, the background classifiers. Left unset,
the window is whatever the server defaults to, and once persona prompt +
tool schemas + memory block + history outgrew it, Ollama ended replies after
a handful of tokens with done_reason 'length' (docs/DECISIONS.md). Keeping
the value identical across calls also matters on its own: Ollama reloads the
model whenever two requests disagree on it. The OpenAI-compatible path has
no per-request way to set it (use OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH on the server).
