"""
Phase 4's tool registry -- what app.py's main conversation loop hands to
llm.stream_reply_with_tools() as available tools, and how it dispatches
a tool_calls event it gets back. One place so adding a new tool later
(Phase 4 Round 2's ocr_region, Phase 11's browser-automation tool, etc.)
means adding one schema + one handler here, not touching app.py's
turn-handling loop itself.
