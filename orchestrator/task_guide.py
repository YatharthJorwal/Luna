"""
Phase 4 Round 2 -- Task Guide Mode's other half (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's
"Task Guide Mode" section): tracking whether a task is currently active,
and checking a screenshot against it. The actual scheduling (waking up
on an interval, deciding when to run a check, speaking the chide) lives
in app.py's `_task_guide_loop`/`_run_task_guide_check` -- this module is
just the state and the one LLM call that turns a screenshot + task
description into an on-task/off-task verdict, kept separate so both
halves stay independently testable (same split as vision.py's
capture_screen/describe_screen).

Single active task at a time, tracked as plain module-level state --
same pattern as app.py's `_driver`/`_scene_state` globals. This is a
single-user, single-driver-connection app (see app.py's driver/observer
comment), so there's never a real need for more than one "what am I
tracking right now" slot; a second concurrent task genuinely doesn't
make sense for one person at one screen.

# Programmatic start/stop detection -- bypasses Ollama's native tool-calling
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Originally, starting/stopping task tracking was left entirely to the
# model's own tool-calling (set_active_task, see tools/__init__.py) --
# the same mechanism capture_screen/read_clipboard already use. Real
# testing showed this doesn't work reliably for *this* tool specifically:
# even on an exact, explicit trigger phrase ("I'm going to work on X,
# keep an eye on me"), qwen3.5:9b never emitted a tool_calls field at
# all across every test turn (confirmed via llm.py's own diagnostic
# logging). Initially suspected as an Ollama-side bug affecting Qwen
# 3.5's tool-calling format specifically (a real, documented bug --
# github.com/ollama/ollama#14493 and related issues -- fixed upstream as
# of Ollama v0.17.6), but the user confirmed running a *newer* Ollama
# (0.34.2) and *also* saw the same 9B model fail to call a tool in a
# completely different agent framework on a direct, explicit command
# ("open a browser"). That combination -- fixed-Ollama-version plus
# cross-framework failure on an explicit ask -- points at a genuine
# capability ceiling for this model size on agentic tool-use, not
# something more prompting can fix.
#
# So: don't fight it. `set_active_task` (the tool) is left in place as a
# redundant path in case the model does call it sometimes, but the
# *reliable* path is this module's own narrow classification call --
# structurally identical to forget.py's maybe_forget() and
# consolidation.py's session distillation, both of which already work
# fine with this same model, because neither depends on Ollama's
# tool-calling machinery at all: just a system prompt asking for a
# small JSON object, and a forgiving parse. Unlike forget.py, there's no
# cheap keyword pre-filter here -- task-starting phrasing is too varied
# for a narrow regex to catch reliably (unlike the word "forget"), and
# given Task Guide Mode is the product's flagship behavior, one extra
# short classification call per turn is a reasonable reliability trade,
# not a wasteful one.

_TASK_DETECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You detect whether a message means the user is starting, continuing, or \
stopping a task they want their AI companion to keep an eye on -- \
distinct from just chatting, asking a question, or mentioning something \

commentary before or after it, in exactly one of these three shapes:

{"action": "start", "description": "short concrete description of the task or step"}
{"action": "stop"}
{"action": "none"}

Use "start" when the message states or clearly implies a task the user \
is about to do or is currently doing -- e.g. "I'm going to debug this \
function", "working on a poster for a bit", "keep an eye on me while I \
do X". "description" should be a short, concrete phrase, not a full \
sentence. Use "stop" only when the message says the task is finished, \
asks to stop being watched, or clearly drops/abandons it -- e.g. "I'm \
done", "stop watching me", "never mind that". A message about doing \
something else for a bit (checking a video, taking a break) is NOT a \
stop -- that is a normal distraction, not the task ending, so use \
"none" for it. Use "none" for everything else, including ordinary \
conversation and questions. When genuinely unsure, use "none" -- a \
missed task is a smaller problem than falsely claiming to track one, or \
falsely ending a real one that's still in progress.\
