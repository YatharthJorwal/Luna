"""
Quick-action menu's Continuous OCR toggle -- ambient screen-watching,
independent of Task Guide Mode's goal-directed drift checking
(task_guide.py). Where that requires an active tracked task and checks
specifically for "has the user drifted off it," this is a general "glance
at the screen every so often and remark on anything genuinely notable"
mode -- no task, no goal, just ambient commentary. Both can run at once;
neither depends on the other.

Explicitly a lower-confidence feature by the user's own framing ("low
stakes... cuz 9b's limit") -- built lean on purpose, expecting it may need
real tuning after actual use, same as everything else vision-related in
this project. The single biggest risk with an ambient-commentary feature
is being naggy/creepy rather than charming, so every design choice here
leans toward under-commenting: a missed genuinely-interesting moment costs
nothing; an unwanted comment about someone's screen costs trust.

Single-slot, module-level state -- same reasoning as task_guide.py's
single-active-task design: this is a single-driver-connection app, so
there's never a genuine need for more than one watch state at a time.
