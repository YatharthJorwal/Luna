"""
SQLite connection + schema for Phase 3 memory. One module-level connection,
same "lazy singleton" shape stt.py already uses for its model -- opened on
first real use, not at import time, so a session that never triggers any
memory read/write (e.g. the very first turn of a fresh DB) doesn't pay for
it up front. Unlike stt.py's model, though, opening a SQLite file + running
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is cheap enough that "lazy" here is really just
"don't touch disk before config is loaded", not a real perf concern.

`sqlite-vec` (https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) is a loadable SQLite
extension providing a `vec0` virtual table for nearest-neighbor search over
float vectors -- pure-C, no GPU/network dependency, ships prebuilt wheels
for Windows/Linux/macOS via `pip install sqlite-vec`, so this doesn't need
its own server process (unlike the LLM/TTS/STT backends) and works offline
same as everything else in this project has to.

Embedding dimension is config, not hardcoded (`memory.embedding.dimension`
in config.yaml) -- it has to match whatever embedding model is configured,
and `vec0` tables declare their vector width at CREATE time, so the
episode_vectors table is created with that exact width baked in. If the
embedding model is ever swapped for one with a different dimension, the
existing table won't match -- see `recall_dimension_mismatch()` below,
checked once at startup rather than left to surface as a cryptic sqlite-vec
error mid-turn.
