"""
Runs once per session, at disconnect (app.py's `finally`) -- distills the
session's real conversation turns into durable memory: candidate facts,
plus one episode summary. Per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's memory design:
"never dump raw message logs into long-term memory -- distill, don't
transcribe."

One extra LLM call, asked to respond with *only* a JSON object:

    {"facts": ["...", "..."], "episode_summary": "..."}

`qwen3.5:9b` is a small model without much reliable structured-output
discipline (same caveat docs/DECISIONS.md already names for why the
Phase 8 emotion system plans to hardcode some triggers rather than trust
a small model's self-reported structured state) -- so parsing here is
deliberately forgiving rather than a strict `json.loads` that throws the
whole session's memory away over one stray sentence before or after the
JSON block. See `_parse_consolidation_output()`.

Degrades independently per piece, same philosophy as recall.py:
- LLM unreachable at session end -> nothing gets distilled, session's
  memory is lost (there's no raw transcript kept to retry from later --
  an accepted limitation, not a bug, per the "distill don't transcribe"
  rule above). Logged, not raised -- a session ending because the user
  closed the app shouldn't ever be blocked by this.
- Facts still get written even if the episode's embedding call fails
  (embedding server down) -- only the episode summary is lost in that
  case, not the facts.
