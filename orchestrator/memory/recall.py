"""
Turns the current user message into a memory context block app.py can
inject into the LLM call for that turn -- "recall injected into the
system prompt each turn" per docs/ROADMAP.md's Phase 3 line.

Injected as a *separate*, ephemeral system message built fresh per call,
never written into the persisted session `history` list app.py keeps --
history stays exactly the real conversation (system persona + user/
assistant turns), so it doesn't grow a stale memory block on every single
turn or get fed back into consolidation.py's session-summarization pass
as if it were something the user or Luna actually said.

Degrades in two independent stages rather than all-or-nothing:
- Facts are plain SQLite reads with no embedding step, so a fact-only
  block still comes back even if the embedding server is down.
- Episode recall needs an embedding of the user's message; if that fails
  (Ollama down, model not pulled), it's skipped and logged, but doesn't
  block facts from still being included.
Returns None only if there is truly nothing to inject (fresh DB, or every
attempted lookup came up empty) -- app.py skips adding a memory message
at all in that case rather than sending an empty/pointless one.
